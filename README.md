The purpose of this project is to showcase what I have learned about design, layout, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.

## Description

GameHub is a project brief detailing the concept of a web store selling new and used games for PC gamers to either get their hands on a brand-new game copy, discover old treasures for a reasonable price, or sell their old games for others to enjoy. The target audience is gamers, mainly between ages 18 to 25, who are interested in buying or selling games.

The brief specified that several pages was expected to be included in the site architecture:

- Home
- List of games
- Product details page
- Checkout page
- Checkout success
- About
- Contact

## Built With

I built this website using the following coding languages and APIs:

- HTML

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
gh repo clone Prebre/2021-10-04_Ida-Katrine-Presttun-Brekken-MA-3_fp
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
