Module Assignment 3, Game Hub Homepage

DEVELOPER COMMENT
This is my first attempt at creating a web page with specific instruction based on my own design. This project is part of my learning process towards becoming a Front-end Developer, and is a module assignment for my studies at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. It shall not be used for any other purpose than for me to practise and improve my skills with HTML and CSS.

ASSIGNMENT INFO
Goal
To deliver a responsive version of your home page for your cross-course project of the website you designed in Design 1.

Brief
You have been tasked with developing the home page of the prototype you built in Design 1.

The home page should:

- Be responsive across screen sizes
- Use neat and semantic HTML
- Have CSS that follows the DRY principle

Level 1 Process

1. Create the HTML for your home page. Use HTML5 elements where appropriate and remember to write unique titles and meta descriptions for the page, as well as ensure your pages are WCAG compliant.
2. Create a CSS file which is linked to your home page.
3. Consider how your page will look across various screen sizes (eg. Single column on mobile, multi-column on larger screens).
4. Write your CSS following the DRY principle.
5. Ensure you’re making regular commits to your repository. Remember, you can view the files locally on your computer before your push changes to your repository.
6. Submit a link to the deployed site on Netlify.

Additional Comments
For your Course Assignment for this course, you will deliver a functional, responsive website of the prototype, but for now we’re just focusing on the home page. You can add other pages to your repository, but the focus will be on the home page.

Certain aspects of your original design might not be possible without JavaScript, and you can either leave these off the HTML and CSS submission or use techniques (like the checkbox hack) to mimic the interactions. For example, you might have an add-to-cart interaction. This can be achieved using the checkbox hack like so https://jsfiddle.net/MJPhillip/0a5vqk43/
